# Volume-control-using-hand-gestures-Hackathon
Abstract:
The purpose of Volume Control using Gestures project is to control volume of the system using hand 
gestures. The system consist a camera to recognise the gesture taken as input by the user. The main goal of hand 
gesture recognition is to create a system which can identify the human hand gestures and use same input as the 
information for controlling the device volume.Hand gestures are used to control the basic operation of a 
computer like increasing and decreasing volume.Therefore,people will not have to learn machine-like skills 
which are a burden most of the time. Hand gesture systems provides a natural and innovative modern way of 
non-verbal communication.These systems has a wide area of application in human computer interaction.In this 
project the system can be controlled by hand gesture without making use of the keyboard and mouse which are 
the traditional approaches to control the device.
Introduction:
Volume Control using Gestures emphasizes the significance of hand gestures as a powerfulcommunication medium in Human Computer Interaction(HCI) and discusses the limitations of traditional input devices. The proposed system aims to utilize hand gestures for interaction with computers, using a desktop or laptop interface utilizing a web camera to record hand gestures.The objective of this project is to develop an interface which will capture human hand gesture dynamically and will control the volume level.This allows users to control the volume of their devices naturally, without the need for explicit instruction and without the need for additional hardware.Volume control using gestures uses OPENCV,Python,Pycaw,Mediapipe are used.
